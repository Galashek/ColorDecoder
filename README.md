## How to play
You need to guess a random sequence of 4 colors in 6 attempts

Game field is divided into 2 columns: attempts and matches

1. Make a guess by clicking ‚ùî- circles and choosing colors from the popup palette (the hidden colors are not repeated)

2. After selecting 4 colors, click the check button and the match-circles will appear on the right column:
  
    - 1 black match means 1 correctly guessed color, but in the wrong position

    - 1 white match means 1 correctly guessed color and its position. Position of white circles is not the same as the position of guessed colors.

3. Relying on the results of your attempts, achieve 4 white matches
